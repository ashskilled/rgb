1.  Open the index.html file inside of the rgb folder. 

        Done

2.  Play the game for a few minutes, get to know it, change the difficulty. 

         Done

    a.  How would you expand the game? What options or settings could you add? 

    I think this game is, like you have to know the correct answer if you dont your just guessing the whole time. 
    To make it easy, give a hint for the answer color. To make it hard you cannot open new tab. 

3.  Using this documentation https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction to guide you: 

    a.  What is the DOM?

    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
    It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
    The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects
    
    b.  When is the DOM different than HTML?
    The DOM contains the HTML. It gives a visual for Hireachy 
     The DOM is a programming interface, DOM is differnt when viewing preference is styled differently. 

    c.  What is the state of the DOM when you first load the page?
    The HTML and CSS is loaded and then JavaScript (where you placed it on the code best practice end of the 
    body for JS)

    d.  What is the state of the DOM if you turn off JavaScript and refresh the page? 
     You have no funcationaly plus the whole block seems to be purple or uni color. 

4.  Now let's explore the code. Use the inspector to investigate the HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

    a.  Which parts of UI are being generated by the HTML file? The CSS? The JavaScript? 
    The whole game is generated using using the HTML, CSS and JS. The contain HTML, The color and size CSS and the function JS. 

    The whole page that we see is generated by the HTML file and the CSS. The click or the listener is generated by JavaScript.

    b.  What happens inside the CSS file when you click on various elements in the page? 


        i.  What elements does the CSS file change? 
        The css changes the color, the button size the look of the webpage generally. When you hover the higlighting is done throug css 
        and the font color and size. padding and margin. 

    c.  What happens inside the HTML file when you click on various elements in the page? 
        Nothing really happens by itslef unless java script or css is implemented. 

    d.  Use breakpoints in the JavaScript to walk through what happens when you click on various elements on the page. 

        i.  What happens when you click on a color block?
         it eiter tells you try again and make the color block dissapppear or changes the all the block to same color
         when the answer is right. 

        ii.  What happens when you click on the winning color block? 
        all the block color becomes the same or the answer color. Your score increases. 

        iii.  What happens when you click "Play again"? 
        all the colors re sets and your given a different rgb to guess. 


        iv.  What HTML and CSS elements can JavaScript change? 
         Adding, removing or modifying HTML and css. 


        v.  How does score keeping work? 
        if you guess wrong you get minus 1 point and if you guess right you get plus 5 pts. 

        vi.  Why does it persist through closing the page? 

        vii.  Using this documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage change the JavaScript file to use session storage instead of local storage. 

        viii.  What's different about the way the score is kept now? 

        ix.  When you win what happens when the title changes? 

        x.  What does Asynchronous mean in the context of JavaScript? 

        xi.  What is the fetch function inside of updateColorName? 

        xii.  What does it do? 

        xiii.  What's an alternative to using fetch? 

        xiv.  Why use one over the other? 

5.  Add comments to the JavaScript code explaining what you think each function does. 

6.  As you went through this process which of the 3E's did you draw from most? How?

    a.  Curiosity, Deal with Uncertainty, Observation Skills
